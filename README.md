## Usage

*Play Song* is an Alfred workflow designed to make playing a song in iTunes extremely quick and convenient.

Type the `play` keyword, followed by a space and a song name, artist, album, or genre. Songs matching your query will automatically populate Alfred's list of results. Choosing a result from the list will play the selected song in iTunes.

Additionally, more actions can be taken using modifier keys:

* Holding down the **Command** key will reveal the selected song in iTunes.

* Holding down the **Option** key will reveal the selected song in the Finder.

* Holding down the **Control** key will search the selected song on Google.
