*Play Song* is an Alfred workflow designed to make playing songs in iTunes extremely quick and convenient.

This latest v2.0 release is a major release, adding the ability to play not only individual songs, but artists, albums, and genres as well.

## Usage

The workflow enables four keywords which allow you to search your iTunes library quickly and easily.

### Playing a song

To play an individual song, use the `play` keyword. Songs matching your query will appear in the results list. Choosing a song from the list will play that song once.

### Playing an artist

To play all songs by a particular artist, use the `playartist` keyword. Choosing a artist from the list will play all songs by that artist (ordered by album).

### Playing an album

To play all songs from a particular album, use the `playalbum` keyword. Choosing an album from the list will play all songs from that album (ordered by track number).

### Playing a genre

To play all songs within a particular genre, use the `playgenre` keyword. Choosing a genre from the list will play all songs within that genre (ordered by album).
